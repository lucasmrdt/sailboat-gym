# Sailboat Gym

> Under the hood, we used a slightly modified version of [usv_sim_lsa](https://github.com/disaster-robotics-proalertas/usv_sim_lsa) to simulate the sailboat dynamics. For more information about the simulation and how it works, please refer to the [forked version](https://github.com/lucasmrdt/usv_sim_lsa).
